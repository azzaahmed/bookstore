1,70,"Anyone who has read J.D. Salinger's New Yorker stories ? particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme ? With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is fully of children. The hero-narrator of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.",The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,1,the catcher in the rye.jpg,9/8/2015 12:45,9/8/2015 12:45

3,150,"Few writers have better captured the times they were writing in as well as Charles Dickens. Dickens' ability to observe and record human character and environment have placed him at the top table of English fiction writers alongside Shakespeare and Austen, and his titles are still as popular today as they were upon first publication. Charles Dickens was a sensation in his own time, his stories as popular upon publication as they are now, where he sits at the summit of English literature. His depictions of Victorian England, in particular, have become so engrained in common consciousness that they are considered as almost historical texts on the age. In this collection you will find the tale of Oliver Twist, the orphan who Dickens used as a vehicle to highlight the unfairness of the Poor Law and the treacherous conditions of London slum life. In Great Expectations we are introduced to a vast array of quirky and interesting characters - from Pip to Estella, Magwitch to Honest Joe - whilst getting a study on class division and personal relationships. The third novel, A Tale of Two Cities, transports us to revolutionary France, where events fascinated Dickens' social interests. The study of Dr Manette's readjustment to freedom from prison is a brilliant demonstration of the author's unrivalled talent for producing fiction of subtlety and depth.","The Works of Charles Dickens: Oliver Twist, Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities Volume 1 (Classic Fiction)", Charles Dickens,1,the works.jpg,9/8/2015 12:45,9/8/2015 12:45

Then, Aphrodite, taking pity on this man whose love could not reach beyond the barrier of stone, brought the statue to life and gave her to Pygmalion as his bride.
Centuries later, George Bernard Shaw captured the magic of this legend in his celebrated romantic play, Pygmalion.

Nicholas Nickleby was Dickens' third novel, and backed up the successes of Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist, with the eponymous hero encountering an array of characters and types in the world of Victorian theatre. A Christmas Carol is the immortal tale of mean Ebenezer Scrooge, who ultimately renounces his curmudgeonly and tight-fisted ways after being visited by ghosts at Christmas time. Hard Times reflects Dickens' deepening interests in social inequalities, the story of a fictional milltown in Lancashire borne from time the author spent in Preston in 1854.","The Works of Charles Dickens: Nicholas Nickleby, Hard Times and a Christmas Carol Volume 2 (Classic Works)",Charles Dickens,1,the works2.jpg,9/8/2015 12:45,9/8/2015 12:45
